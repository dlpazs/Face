* a novel detector that aims to include better feature learning, progressive loss design and anchor assign based data augmentation
* Firstly, they propose a Feature Enhance Module (FEM) for enhancing the original feature maps to extend the SSD to Dual Shot Detector.
* Secondly, they adopt a Progressive Anchor Loss (PAL) computed by two different sets of anchors to effectively facilitate the features.
* Thirdly, they use an Improved Anchor Matching (IAM) by integrating novel anchor assign strategy into data augmentation
to provide better initialization for the regressor
* Previous SOTA can be divided into: Region proposal network (RPN) adopted in Faster-RCNN and employs two stage detection shemes
* RPN is trained end-to-end and generates high-quality region proposals which are further refined by Fast R-CNN
* The other is Single SHot Detector (SSD) based on one-stage methods, which get rid of RPN and directly predict the bounding boxes confidence
* SSD has attracted more attention due to higher inference efficiency
* Currently Feature Pyramid Network is widely used in SOTA face detectors for rich featuers, but FPN just aggregates hierarchical feature maps between high and low-level output layers not considering the current layer's information and context relationship between anchors is ignored
* The typical loss is a regression loss for face region and classification loss for identifying if a face is detected or not
* Focal Loss is used to train on spare set of hard examples. 
* Hierarchical loss to effictively learn the network. The above loss do not consider progressive learning ability of feature maps in both different levels and shots
* Pre-set anchors for each feature map are generated by regularly tiling a collection of boxes with different scales and aspect reations on the image
* Such strategy ignores random sampling in data augmentation, causing imbalance between positive and negative anchors
* They solve the problems with
* Feature Enhance Module to enhance the discriminability and robustness of features, which combines the advantages of the FPN in PyramidBox and Receptive Field Block (RFB) in RFBNet
* Progressive Anchor Loss motivated by hierarchical loss and pyramid anchor that uses progressive anchor sizes for different levels. They assign smaller anchor sizes in the first shot and use larger sizes in the second shot
* Improved Anchor Matching (IAM), which integrates anchor partition strategy and anchor-based data augmentation to match anchors and ground truth faces providing better initialization for the regressor
