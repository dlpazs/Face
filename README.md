## Facial Recognition

Facial recognition is the task of making a **positive identification* of a face in a photo or video image against a pre-**existing database of faces**. It begins with **detection** - distinguishing human faces from other objects in the image - and then works on **identification** of those detected faces.

## Face Detection

Face detection is the task of detecting faces in a photo or video (and distinguishing them from other objects).

## Face Verification

Face verification is the task of comparing a candidate face to another, and verifying whether it is a match. It is a one-to-one mapping: you have to check if this person is the correct one.

## Face Alignment

Face alignment is the task of identifying the geometric structure of faces in digital images, and attempting to obtain a canonical alignment of the face based on translation, scale, and rotation.
