# Testing of Face Recognition Models

[Balancing Facial Recognition Performance and Accuracy in the Real World](https://safr.com/general/balancing-facial-recognition-performance-and-accuracy-in-the-real-world/)

- NIST conducts an on-going battery of tests, known as the Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT), to measure the key characteristics of facial recognition algorithms, including accuracy, performance, and bias.
- NIST not only measures specific characteristics of facial algorithms, such as performance, accuracy, and bias, the standards and measurements body also reports on those attributes by image type, such as visa photos, mugshots, webcam, or “wild” images. Wild images are camera unaware faces captured on video: complex because the faces may be tilted, with wide yaw and pitch pose variation. Not to mention there may be many faces within a video frame. Wild images are challenging facial qualities that are precisely the type of real-world conditions for which SAFR was designed. NIST conducts its tests of facial recognition using still photographs. Facial recognition in live video requires concerted optimization in acquisition, accuracy, and speed.
- SAFR from RealNetworks is the most accurate high-performance facial recognition algorithm for live video as tested by NIST.
