# RetinaFace: Single-stage Dense Face Localisation in the Wild

[link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00641.pdf)

- face localisation remains a challenge in uncontrolled face detection
- They propose a robust single-stage face detector which performs pixel-wise face 
localisation on various scales of faces by taking advantage of joint
extra-supervised and self-supervised multi-task learning
- They contribute by: (1) manually annotating five facial landmarks
on WIDER Face and observe significant improvement in hard face detection
with assistance of this extra supervision signal
