Notes

- IJB-C : advances the goal of robust unconstrained face recognition. Emphasis on occlusion, diversity of occupation, 
geographic origin with the goal of improving representation of global population. IJB-C adds 1,661 new subjects to IJB-B. 
Best benchmark for unconstrained face recognition. 

- Though research has shown vision systems are performing at **near-human levels of face recognition accuracy on constrained
face imagery, the performance of these systems still lags behind human performance on unconstrained imagery**
